## 🐾 What is Tamadoge?

Tamadoge is a play-to-earn NFT ecosystem where players raise, feed, and train digital pets. These pets can be used in competitive arcade-style mini-games where players earn $TAMA tokens. With full Web3 integration, all pets, items, and cosmetics are NFTs tradable on-chain.

As part of the Tamaverse, players participate in tournaments, upgrade their pet's strength, and climb the leaderboards for crypto rewards.
